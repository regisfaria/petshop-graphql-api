# Petshop Graphql API

## Overview

This is a simple project done with GraphQL, Express and Apollo Server.

I've used Prisma as my ORM

The project is to be a simple API to handle registrations of users and pets for a petshop.

You can freely query/mutate through both entities. Once the server is started, you can access it at: `http://localhost:4010/graphql` and use it's interface to do your operations.

## Installation & Running

First of all you need to make sure you're using the latest LTS version of `nodejs` and one of its packages managers, such as `npm` or `yarn`.

Then you can install the dependencies with: `yarn` or `npm install`

It's important that you have a running PostgreSQL database, since it's the database used in the project. You will find a file called `.env.example`, you must copy it and change it's name to `.env`.
*make sure to edit the .env content with your database information, as well the DB to be used*

Once you've done that, run the following command: `yarn prisma migrate dev` *or* `npm run prisma migrate dev`

And then you're all set! ðŸŽ‰

Run the server with: `yarn dev` *or* `npm run dev`, it will be running on port ***4010**.
